## Description

```
Two pale sisters, all alone,
On an island bleak and bare,
Listening to the breakers' moan,
Shivering in the chilly air;
Looking inland towards a hill,
On whose top one aged tree
Wrestles with the storm-wind's will,
Rushing, wrathful, from the sea.

## Hint

```
I’m tall but I’m not a basketball player
I’m thin but I’m not a flagpole
I shine but I’m not the sun
I help sailors but I’m not an anchor
I’m a building but I’m not a skyscraper
