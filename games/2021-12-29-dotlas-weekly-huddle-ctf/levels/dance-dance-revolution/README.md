## Description

```
Well, the music/tunes and the background definitely complemented each other.
Before I knew about this news in the morning, I was doing my normal thing and was recording a video for a competition.
I guess this video is now my little keepsake!

As I was dancing, helicopters were going whirl-whirl-whirl*, cars going vroom-vroom.
With all the (big) guns, I thought someone was aiming at me from a distance.
The police chiefs were just smiling and looking at me, even asking me if I was going home and bid me farewell.

Please do not copy and paste my video though
