## Description

```
She STOLE your heart the day you met her.

You were afraid.
But, TO LOVE, YOU NEED COURAGE.

She was your partner in CRIME.
Take a look at all the places you visited together.

The two of you had a good run of 5 YEARS.
Now, it's time to move on.

## Solution

Each file represents a city, with its name as the coordinates of that city.
They are:

- _Lisbon_, Portugal
- _Rio de Janeiro_, Brazil
- _Denver_, Colorado, USA
- _Berlin_, Germany
- _Stockholm_, Sweden
- _Nairobi_, Kenya
- _Moscow_, Russia
- _Tokyo_, Japan

These cities are the _code names_ taken by the squad in Netflix's heist crime drama, `Money Heist`, a.k.a `La Casa de Papel` which recently released its 5th and final season.
